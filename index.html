    Hey there! Since you've landed on my little corner of the web, why not swing by my GitHub? I've got some Home Assistant blueprints brewing that you might find super handy. There's one for catching those pesky offline Frigate cameras, plus neat setups for Plex and Jellyfin webhooks.
    <a href="https://github.com/thenextbutton/home_assistant/tree/main/blueprints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go on, have a look â€“ your smart home might just thank you!</a>
