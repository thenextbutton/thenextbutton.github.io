  <h3>ðŸ’» What I'm Working On</h3>
  <p>Currently focusing on improving my personal website, experimenting with new CSS animations, and refining my JavaScript skills. I'm also diving deeper into cloud technologies, specifically Azure and AWS, to broaden my infrastructure knowledge.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ“º What I'm Watching</h3>
  <p>Lately, I've been enjoying documentaries on space exploration and historical events. Also catching up on the latest season of "The Expanse" â€“ a fantastic sci-fi series!</p>

  <h3>ðŸŽ§ What I'm Listening To</h3>
  <p>My playlist is a mix of instrumental synthwave for focus, and various tech podcasts for learning. Sometimes a bit of classic rock to unwind.</p>
