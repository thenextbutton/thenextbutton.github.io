Hello, and Welcome to the Digital Infrastructure.
</h2>
This site is my sandbox for **Home Automation** and **infrastructure** work, where I post the odd bits of code, configuration files, and YAML that make my digital world tick. If you're here for grunge, gothic drama, or server talk, you've found the right corner of the internet.

    Since you've landed on my little corner of the web, why not swing by my GitHub? I've got some Home Assistant blueprints brewing that you might find super handy. There's one for catching Frigate cameras that go offline, plus neat setups for Plex and Jellyfin webhooks.
